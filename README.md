# PERCH

PERCH is a software suite for the interpretation of rare or common genetic variants, including SNVs, InDels, structural variations, and de novo mutations. It evaluates the deleteriousness of variants, ranks genes for candidate selection, classifies variants as pathogenic or benign to a disease. It is useful for both gene discovery research and clinical genetic testing. The source code of PERCH can be found in the [VICTOR](https://github.com/fengbjlab/victor) repository.
